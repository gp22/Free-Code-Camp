          <h3>Here's a timeline of Thompson's life:</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="row body-text">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Jul 18th, 1937</strong> - Born in Louisville, KY</li>
            <li><strong>1952</strong> - His father's death. Thompson had a turbulent youth after the death of his father left the family in poverty. He was unable to formally finish high school as he was jailed for 60 days after abetting a robbery.</li>
            <li><strong>1956</strong> - Joins US army. Hunter joined the United States Air Force before moving into journalism. He joined the army to hide from his employer, because he crashed a service truck.</li>
            <li><strong>1958</strong> - Leaves army. When he was 18, he was fired from the army for insubordination and bad influence on others.</li>
            <li><strong>1959</strong> - Joined Time magazine, but was soon fired again for insubordination. In the same year he worked as a reporter in New York, and was fired for fighting with the manager and damaging a vending machine with chocolate.</li>
            <li><strong>1961</strong> - Work at Big Sur Hot Springs. Thompson served as a guard and caretaker at Big Sur Hot Springs. At the same time, he wrote two novels "Prince jellyfish" and "The Rum Diary"</li>
            <li><strong>1963</strong> - Marriage. Hunter married his longtime girlfriend Sandra Conklin.</li>
            <li><strong>1964</strong> - Hunter's son's birth. Hunter and Sandra had a son Juan.</li>
            <li><strong>1965</strong> - Carey McWilliams, editor of The Nation, hired Thompson to write a story about the California-based Hells Angels* motorcycle club. He spent the next year living and riding with the gang. The relationship broke down when the bikers perceived that Thompson was exploiting them for personal gain, and demanded a share of the profits from his writings. An argument at a party resulted in a savage beating for Thompson (or "stomping", as the Angels referred to it).</li>
            <li><strong>1967</strong> - "Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs" - Thompson became internationally known with the publication of Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (1967), for which he had spent a year living and riding with the Angels, experiencing their lives and hearing their stories first hand.</li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - "Gonzo" - With the publication in 1970 of "The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved" he became a counter cultural figure, with his own brand of New Journalism he termed "Gonzo", an experimental style of journalism where reporters involve themselves in the action so much that they become central figures of their stories. Despite the fact that the article was for a sports magazine, least of all attention is paid directly to the horse racing.</li>
            <li><strong>1971</strong> - "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" - In 1971 Hunter published the book for which he gained most of his fame - "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" in Rolling Stone. It was a kind of first-person report from a journalist (Thompson himself under the pseudonym "Raoul Duke") on a trip to Las Vegas with a lawyer "Dr. Gonzo" (Hunter's friend) whose aim was to describe the legendary motorcycles racing "Mint 400", and then a police drug conference.</li>
            <li><strong>1980</strong> - Divorce. Hunter and Sandy divorced in 1980 but always remained close friends.</li>
            <li><strong>1993</strong> - Hunter's brother's death. James Thompson dies from AIDS</li>
            <li><strong>2003</strong> - 2nd marriage. Thompson married his longtime assistant, Anita Bejmuk</li>
            <li><strong>2003</strong> - "Kingdom of Fear" - Kingdom of Fear, combined new material, selected newspaper clippings, and some older works. There was described an expirience about how he was accused of sexual assault and possession of cocaine. An 11-hour search of Thompson's home turned up various kinds of drugs and a few sticks of dynamite.</li>
            <li><strong>2005</strong> - Suicide. Thompson died at Owl Farm, in Woody Creek, Colorado, at 5:42 p.m. on February 20, 2005 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Anita Thompson, who was at The Aspen Club, was on the phone with her husband as he cocked the gun. It was a premeditated act resulting from his many painful and chronic medical conditions, which included a hip replacement.</li>
